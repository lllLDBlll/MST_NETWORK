BORUKVAS:
Boruvka's algorithm is an algorithm for finding a minimum spanning tree in a graph for which all edge weights are distinct, or a minimum spanning forest in the case of a graph that is not connected.

KRUSKAL:
This algorithm first appeared in Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society, pp. 48–50 in 1956, and was written by Joseph Kruskal.[2]

PRIMS:
The algorithm was developed in 1930 by Czech mathematician Vojtech Jarník[1] and later rediscovered and republished by computer scientists Robert C. Prim in 1957[2] and Edsger W. Dijkstra in
